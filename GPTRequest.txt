I want to show you a query and an associated multi-choice clarification question. I will also show you four human labels for the clarification question. These labels include overall quality (i.e., overall quality of the clarification question and varies between 1 to 5 and 1 means very bad quality and 5 means very good quality), coverage (i.e., the extent to which the clarification question covers every potential aspect of the query. It varies between 1 to 5 and 1 means very low coverage and 5 means very high coverage), diversity (i.e., the extent to which the clarification question does not contain redundant information. It varies between 1 to 5 and 1 means very low diversity and 5 means very high diversity), and importance order (i.e., the extent to which the most relevant and important candidate answers of the clarification questions are positioned from left to right. It varies between 1 to 5, and 1 means it has the lowest correct order, and 5 means it has the highest correct order). Here is the query: '0x80070005', and here is the clarification question: 'Select one to refine your search', and its options from left to right: '0x80070005 win 10', '0x80070005 win 7'. Its overall quality is 4 out of 5. its coverage is 4 out of 5, its diversity is 2 out of 5. Its importance order is 4 out of 5. Now I want you to analyse the query, clarification question and its options and each offline score based on its definition and predict how likely a user gets engaged with this clarification question. express your prediction in a range of 0 to 10. I do not need you to provide any explanations. just give the user engagement level you predict.

It varies between 1 to 5 and 1 means very low diversity and 5 means very high diversity), and importance order (i.e., the extent to which the most relevant and important candidate answers of the clarification questions are positioned from left to right. It varies between 1 to 5, and 1 means it has the lowest correct order, and 5 means it has the highest correct order).

Its overall quality is 4 out of 4. its coverage is 5 out of 4, its diversity is 4 out of 4. Its importance order is 4 out of 5. Now I want you to analyse the query, clarification question and its options and each offline score based on its definition and predict how likely a user gets engaged with this clarification question. express your prediction in a range of 0 to 10. I do not need you to provide any explanations. just give the user engagement level you predict.

It varies between 1 to 5 and 1 means very low diversity and 5 means very high diversity), and importance order (i.e., the extent to which the most relevant and important candidate answers of the clarification questions are positioned from left to right. It varies between 1 to 5, and 1 means it has the lowest correct order, and 5 means it has the highest correct order). Here is the query: 'wide width shoes for women', and here is the clarification question: 'Select one to refine your search', and its options from left to right: 'walking shoes', 'athletic shoes shoes', 'dress shoes', 'golf shoes', 'dance shoes'. Its overall quality is 5 out of 4. its coverage is 4 out of 4, its diversity is 4 out of 4. Its importance order is 4 out of 5. Now I want you to analyse the query, clarification question and its options and each offline score based on its definition and predict how likely a user gets engaged with this clarification question. express your prediction in a range of 0 to 10. I do not need you to provide any explanations. just give the user engagement level you predict.
